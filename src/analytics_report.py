            Spending Trends:

                Summarize the overall spending patterns, including total spending, average spending per invoice, and spending fluctuations over time.
                Highlight the top spending periods (e.g., months, quarters, or years).
                Identify categories, vendors, or clients contributing the most to spending.

            Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

                Analyze the total number of invoices and the average number of items per invoice.
                Highlight high-value invoices (e.g., those exceeding a specific threshold).
                Report on vendor/client contributions to spending or revenue 

            Product or Service Usage Insights:

                Identify the most frequently purchased products or services and their revenue contributions.
                Highlight any underutilized or low-demand products/services.
                Note trends in product/service usage (e.g., increasing or decreasing demand).
                Rank the top product/service categories based on sales volume or revenue.

            Actionable Insights:

                Provide recommendations for optimizing spending, improving product/service utilization, or addressing any identified issues."
                Additional Instructions:
                Format the report with clear sections and bullet points for readability.
                Use quantitative metrics and percentages wherever possible.
                Ensure insights are actionable and backed by data trends.'''
