```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):

For Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Start the application:
```bash

```

3. Upload Invoices:
   - Click on the upload button
   - Select multiple invoice files
   - Wait for processing

4. Analyze Data:
   - Select a column from the available dropdown menu
   - The application will automatically display relevant pre-configured visualizations for that column
   - Each column has specific graph types associated with it based on the data type and analysis requirements

5. When finished, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

## 📊 Visualization System

The application uses an intelligent visualization system where:
- Each data column has predefined graph types associated with it
- Appropriate visualizations are automatically displayed based on the selected column
- Graphs are pre-configured to best represent the data type of each column
- Users don't need to choose graph types - the system automatically shows the most relevant visualization
